# TMtopo
Properties and Quantum Topological Descriptors for Transition Metal Complexes

## Description
The TMtopo repository contains the latest updated version of the TMtopo
database, which consists of equilibrium geometries, quantum calculated
properties and quantum topological descriptors for a large number of first-row
transition metal complexes. All properties were calculated at the
TPSSh/Def2-TZVP level of theory and are provided in the form of a distributed
database (one ascii text file per entry). Some Python code exemplifying data
colecction and processing is also supplied in the ```example_code``` directory.
